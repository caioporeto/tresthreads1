# tresthreads1
This repository was made by Caio Felipe Poreto and Vinicius Kawakami Harrop Galv√£o in their first year of Engineering studies in Poli USP. The code was developed for Operating Systems class, in which was proposed to use Zephyr in a Freedom KL25Z microcontroller so students could have the first interactions with OS problems, documentation and others "obstacles".

With that, the target was to learn how to manipulate threads and, consequently, mutexes, synchronization mechanisms that allows threads to run without dead-locks or starving.
